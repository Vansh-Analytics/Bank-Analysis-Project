# Bank-Analysis-Project
🏦 Bank Data Analysis Project (SQL • Excel • Power BI • Tableau)

This project presents a comprehensive end-to-end bank data analysis using SQL, Excel, Power BI, and Tableau, focusing on transforming raw banking data into meaningful insights and interactive dashboards that support data-driven decision-making.

The goal of this project is to simulate a real-world banking analytics scenario, where data is collected from multiple sources, cleaned and analyzed, and finally visualized for business users and stakeholders.

🔍 Project Overview

The analysis begins with SQL, where raw banking data is queried, filtered, joined, and aggregated to prepare structured datasets. These datasets are then processed in Excel for data cleaning, validation, and preliminary analysis. Key metrics and summaries are created using formulas and pivot tables.

The cleaned and processed data is further analyzed in Power BI and Tableau, where interactive dashboards are built to visualize customer behavior, account performance, loan trends, and financial indicators. These dashboards allow users to filter data by region, account type, and customer segments for deeper insights.
